# Autoregressive (AR) Model

When we see a sinusoidal pattern in the ACF plot of a stationary process, this is a hint that an autoregressive process is at play, and we must use an AR(p) model to produce our forecast. Just like the MA(q) model, the AR(p) model will require us to identify its order. This time we will have to plot the partial autocorrelation function and see at which lag the coefficients suddenly become non-significant. The next chapter will focus entirely on the autoregressive process, how to identify its order, and how to forecast such a process.

- Defining the partial autocorrelation function (PACF)
- Using the PACF plot to determine the order of an autoregressive process
- Forecasting a time series using the autoregressive model
