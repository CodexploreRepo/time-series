### Tips

- Forecasting feature selection problem: at time making predictions, we cannot use the features that are not available.
  - For example, if we cannot use the temperature as a feature to predict power consumption over the next day as we dont have the value of temperature in the next day
- List of Time-series models: https://unit8co.github.io/darts/
- When creating time-series features (especially rolling or lag), remember to DROP `NaN`

### Backtesting

- Backtesting methods with the use of Scikit-learn's `TimeSeriesSplit`

## Day 1

### Differentiation

- ARIMA assumes the stationarity of the data. If non-stationarity is found, the series should be differenced until stationarity is achieved. This analysis helps to determine the optimal value of the parameter $ùëë$.
- `df.diff()` calculates the difference of a DataFrame element compared with another element in the DataFrame (default is element in previous row).
  - Note: usually go along with dropna `df.diff().dropna()`

### Feature Engineering

#### Time Series Features

- Time series features to see how the trends are impacted by day of week, hour, time of year + holiday factor.
  - Note: for Weekday factor we can assign different weight for different day in a week

```Python
df['date'] = df.index
df['hour'] = df['date'].dt.hour
df['dayofweek'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek
df['quarter'] = df['date'].dt.quarter
df['month'] = df['date'].dt.month
df['year'] = df['date'].dt.year
df['dayofyear'] = df['date'].dt.dayofyear
df['dayofmonth'] = df['date'].dt.day
df['weekofyear'] = df['date'].dt.weekofyear
```

- Also can include `is_holiday` col

```Python
import holidays
us_holidays = holidays.US()
df['ds'] = df.index
df['isholiday'] = df['ds'].apply(lambda x : x in us_holidays).astype(np.int32)
df.drop(columns = ['ds'], inplace=True)
```

#### Technical Indicator Features

- **Lag** features are added to convert time series forecasting as a supervised Machine Learning problem
  - Lag with respect to a time step $t$ is defined as the values of the series at previous $t$ time steps.
  - For example, lag 1 is the value at time step $t-1$ and lag $m$ is the value at time step $t-m$
- **Rolling (mean, std, min, max)**
- **Rate of Change**

### FB Prophet Model

- Prophet model expects the dataset to be named a specific way.
  - Including the holidays

```Python
from fbprophet import Prophet

# Setup and train model and fit by convert
# .reset_index() to convert datetime index to 'Datetime' col
# 'Datetime' col to 'ds'
# 'Target' col to 'y'
model = Prophet()
model.fit(df.reset_index() \
              .rename(columns={'Datetime':'ds',
                               'Target':'y'}))
"""
including holidays
"""

# Create a dataframe with holiday, ds columns
from pandas.tseries.holiday import USFederalHolidayCalendar as calendar

cal = calendar()

df['date'] = df.index.date
df['is_holiday'] = df.date.isin([d.date() for d in cal.holidays()])
holiday_df = df.loc[df['is_holiday']] \
    .reset_index() \
    .rename(columns={'Datetime':'ds'})
# create 'holiday' col in holiday_df and provide what is the holiday name
holiday_df['holiday'] = 'USFederalHoliday'
holiday_df = holiday_df.drop(['is_holiday'], axis=1)
# final holiday_df will have 2 cols only: 'ds' and 'holiday'
holiday_df['ds'] = pd.to_datetime(holiday_df['ds'])

# Init and train model with holidays
model_with_holidays = Prophet(holidays=holiday_df)
```

### Tips

- When dealing with time-series data, it is better to use dates as the index of the dataframe
